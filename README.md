# 2.5D_Whisper_gallery_resonator_qubit_system
This project demonstrates the feasibility of coupling a 2D planar aperture transmon qubit with a 3D whispering gallery mode resonator, establishing a hybrid 2.5D coupling mechanism.We are demonstrating a ”2.5D Whisper-gallery mode resonator qubit system” by using the aperture concept in the conducting boundary of the resonator for greater electromagnetic energy confinement to have better coherence time.
